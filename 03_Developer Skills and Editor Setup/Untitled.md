#### 4 Steps to solve any problem

1. Make sure we 100% understand the problem. Ask the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem
   
2. Divide the problem into smaller sub-problem
   
3.  Don't be afraid to do as much research as we have to do
     
4.  For bigger problems, write pseudo-code before writing the actual code

In case of _`Prompt`_ it always return a string no matter what we enter


_Debugging_ means to run your code step by step in a debugging tool like Visual Studio, to find the exact point where you made a programming mistake.
