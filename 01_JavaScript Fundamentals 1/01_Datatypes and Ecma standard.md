In earlier days the JS engine which is used to compile the JS code is being attached to the browser so *node JS is not anything special but it is that JS engine which is being separated from the browser*

so some JS code like using alert and then compile in node JS will give error but it will not **error if we firstly bind an HTML file with JS and then use alert then**

- In JS *null* is a standalone value and **undefine** means *we haven't define the value* but difference between them is `in case of null it truly represent the empty value`  and `undefine means we have written the variable and haven't initialised the value yet`
