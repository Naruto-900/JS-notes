### 3. Focused

A software engineer who understands their work’s purpose can manage multiple projects effectively. They should balance passion with discipline, avoiding unnecessary diversions or over-optimization. This focus on relevant tasks leads to productive teams and successful software


### 4.  **(Sub-)Domain Expert**

Companies often prefer hiring specialists over generalists. Generalists, while having a broad knowledge base and solid fundamentals, may not have the deep expertise in a specific technology subdomain that specialists possess.


### 5. Team Player

A good software engineer not only excels in coding but also in teamwork. They should be adaptable, able to write clean, understandable code and documentation, and accept feedback without taking it personally. Their code should align with the team’s standards and existing codebase, demonstrating their ability to contribute effectively to the team’s collective work.


### 6.  Communicator

Having employable communication skills doesn’t mean you need to be an extrovert. Good communication skills boil down to your ability to explain the projects you're working on, ask for help, brainstorm ideas, collaborate with teammates, listen well, and accept constructive criticism.


### 7. Problem Solver

Software developers should quickly identify and efficiently resolve issues, whether they’re bugs, scalability problems, or maintainability matters. Their solutions should be clear and concise.


### 8. CraftPerson

Great programmers care deeply about their work. They write good, tested code and pay attention to details, while also delivering on time. They’re not just skilled, they use their skills creatively. Employers value this dedication to quality.


### 9. Ownership

A good software engineer takes charge of their work, showing they can handle a project with confidence. They don’t wait to be told what to do, but are proactive and work independently. But also handle the bad things very nicely

### 10.  **Business Acumen**

A software engineer with business sense understands how their work affects the company’s success. They can see the big picture and make decisions that balance perfect code with business needs. This means focusing on delivering the product first, then improving it later. This balance is important for all levels of software engineering.


_`Ten out of ten times, an employer would rather hire a software engineer who works well with their team, learns quickly, and is ready to hit the ground running than a candidate who is highly skilled but uninterested in adapting, communicates poorly, and shows little interest in the craft.`_

3.  You Don't need high end laptop for programming
4. We don't have to memorise things in programming instead use AI for ur help 
5. And more projects we build better we become


Nothing is not wrong in the programming our main focus is to get the job done by anyway
